{"id":"cs-e0g","title":"Buff all skills to B-grade CSO","description":"19 of 34 skills score F on CSO. Systematic improvement needed: add timing gates (MANDATORY/BEFORE/FIRST), add trigger phrases in quotes, add method previews. Use skill-forge tools to validate.","design":"Priority order: 1) Fix 6 name/directory mismatches first (blocking errors), 2) Session lifecycle skills (session-opening, session-closing), 3) High-use skills (todoist-gtd, beads, google-workspace), 4) Anthropic skills if we want to PR upstream. Target: all skills B-grade (80+) or higher.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"spm1001@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-01-31T19:52:47.292309Z","created_by":"spm1001","updated_at":"2026-01-31T19:52:47.292309Z"}
{"id":"cs-gs6","title":"Fix skill name/directory mismatches","description":"6 skills have name/dir mismatches because repos are named skill-* but symlinked without prefix. Affected: chrome-log, dbt, google-workspace, itv-styling, mem, appscript. Either rename repos or teach linter about symlinks.","design":"Option A: Rename repos to drop skill- prefix. Option B: Update linter to resolve symlinks and check the actual skill name vs resolved path. Option A is cleaner but more disruptive.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"spm1001@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-01-31T19:52:56.159933Z","created_by":"spm1001","updated_at":"2026-01-31T19:52:56.159933Z"}

Skills in repos named skill-foo are symlinked to ~/.claude/skills/foo, causing false name mismatch errors.","design":"In check_name(), resolve skill_dir with Path.resolve() before comparing to name.
